# ✅ TRUSTED PARTNERS SECTION UPDATED

## Enhancement: Professional Logo Marquee

I have completely redesigned the "Trusted by 200+ Hiring Partners" section to be more professional and dynamic.

### ✨ Key Changes:

1.  **Running Line Animation**:
    - Implemented a smooth, infinite scrolling marquee.
    - Logos scroll seamlessly from right to left.

2.  **Professional SaaS Style**:
    - **Clean & Minimal**: Logos start with **50% opacity** (subtle).
    - **Interactive Hover**: On hover, logos become **100% visible**, scale up slightly (`scale-105`), and show their brand colors.
    - **Company Names**: Added clear text labels (Google, Amazon, Tesla, etc.) next to icons.

3.  **Edge Fading**:
    - Added **gradient masks** on the left and right edges so logos fade in/out smoothly, avoiding harsh cut-offs.

### 🏢 Featured "Partners":
- **Google** (Chrome icon)
- **Salesforce** (Cloud icon)
- **Amazon** (ShoppingBag icon)
- **Apple** (Command icon)
- **Tesla** (Zap icon)
- And more...
